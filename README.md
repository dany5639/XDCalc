# XDCalc
Calculator that can interpret simple operations in decimal or hexadecimal.

Left input box should receive decimal numbers and simple operations. Right input box is the same but using hexadecimal.

Values should be limited to uint64.

Potential changes:
- Parantheses
- Editing lines to recalculate
